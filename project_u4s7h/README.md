## TFT Comp Builder  
***
For my term project I want to make a **TFT Comp Builder**. The user should be able to 
put any champions and items on a typical TFT board. This way the user would be able to 
pre-build their comps before the game or save a comp they really like for future games.
The users of this application would be *beginner* TFT players who can't remember comps 
or can't play the game *flexibly*. This project is interesting to me because I am a TFT player
myself and this is something I wish I had when I was learning the game.

## User Stories 
***
As a user I want to be able to:
* Make TFT board and add/remove champions to it 
* Add each board to a collection of boards
* Be able to view the board I just made and view the collection of boards I have
* Be able to view my collection of boards
* I want to be able to save my collection of boards to file 
* I want to be able have the option to load my collection of boards from file

## Phase 4: Task 3
***
If I had more time I would definitely make the board look more like a TFT Board in the GUI.
I would also give more functionality for each unit on the board, such as being able to see
the trait of the unit. I would also add a synergy counter for the board as well as board size
based on amount of units placed because in TFT you can only have 9 units on the board and some units
take up 2 units worth of space.
